# Icon documentation

Heartless uses some icons from Microsoft's Fluent UI icon set. Those icons are under the MIT license. They are also documented
below as to which icon file corresponds to which icon in Microsoft's set, since icons from that set can be hard to find sometimes
due to Microsoft's naming scheme. All icons are used with the regular style unless otherwise specified.

If you want to add a new icon but can't find the right one, try looking at [fluenticons.co](https://fluenticons.co/).
